   Indexes can support the efficient execution of queries. Without
   indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e. scan every
   document in a collection, to select those documents that match the
   query statement. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB
   can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.
   
   Use the {{index}} method to create an
   index on a collection. Indexes can support the efficient execution of
   queries. MongoDB automatically creates an index on the ``_id`` field
   upon the creation of a collection.

   To create an index on a field or fields, pass to the {{index}} method
   an index key specification document that lists the fields to index and
   the index type for each field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: <type1>, ...}

   - For an ascending index type, specify ``1`` for ``<type>``.
   - For a descending index type, specify ``-1`` for ``<type>``.

   {{index}} only creates an index if the index does not exist.
