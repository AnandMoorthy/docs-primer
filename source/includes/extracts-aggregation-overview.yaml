  MongoDB can perform aggregation operations, such as grouping by a
  specified key and evaluating a total or a count for each distinct group.

  You can use the {{aggregate}} method to
  perform a stage-based aggregation. The
  {{aggregate}} method accepts as its argument a pipeline_
  of stages, where each :manual:`stage
  </meta/aggregation-quick-reference>`, processed sequentially, describes
  a data processing step.
