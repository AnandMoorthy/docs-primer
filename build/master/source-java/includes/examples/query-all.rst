To return all documents in a collection, call the find_  method
*without* a criteria document. For example, the following operation
queries for all documents in the ``restaurants`` collection.

.. literalinclude:: includes/example-java-query-all.java
   :language: java

.. include:: includes/example-java-query-all-pre1.rst

.. literalinclude:: includes/example-java-query-all-pre1.java
   :language: java

The result set contains all documents in the ``restaurants`` collection.
