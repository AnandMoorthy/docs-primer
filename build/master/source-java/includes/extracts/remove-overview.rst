You can use the deleteOne_ method and the deleteMany_ method to remove
documents from a collection. The method takes a conditions document
that determines the documents to remove.

To specify a remove condition, use the same structure and syntax as the
query conditions. See :doc:`/query` for an introduction to query
conditions.
