To return all documents in a collection, call the find_  method with an
*empty* criteria document. For example, the following operation queries
for all documents in the ``restaurants`` collection.

.. literalinclude:: includes/example-cpp-query-all.cpp
   :language: cpp

The result set contains all documents in the ``restaurants`` collection.
