You can use the :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one` method and the :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many` method to add documents to a
:term:`collection` in MongoDB. If you attempt to add documents to a
collection that does not exist, MongoDB will create the collection
for you.
