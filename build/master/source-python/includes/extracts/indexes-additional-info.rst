You can specify various properties for indexes, such as a
:manual:`unique constraint </core/index-unique>`. In the PyMongo documentation,
see :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index()` for the available options.

MongoDB provides different index types to support different
kinds of queries and datasets. In the MongoDB Manual, see the
:manual:`Index Introduction </core/indexes-introduction>` for the
different index types supported in MongoDB.
