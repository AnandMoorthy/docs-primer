   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In Windows Explorer, locate the downloaded MongoDB ``.msi`` file, which
   typically is located in the default ``Downloads`` folder. Double-click
   the ``.msi`` file. A set of screens will appear to guide you through the
   installation process.
   
   You may specify an installation directory if you choose the "Custom"
   installation option. These instructions assume that you have
   installed MongoDB to ``C:\mongodb``.
   

   MongoDB is self-contained and does not have any other system
   dependencies. You can run MongoDB from any folder you choose. You may
   install MongoDB in any folder (e.g. ``D:\test\mongodb``).
